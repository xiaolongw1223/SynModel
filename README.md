# SynModel
This is a collection of synthetic/realistic models used in Xiaolong's work, where each model can be used to test inversion code and algorithms. 

Currently, a synthetic model includes four parts:
 - mesh file: " .msh"
 - simulated data with UBC format: " .obs"
 - topography: " .txt"
 - true model: " .txt"
